# My Locations

Sample app based on [React] & [Redux].
The interface provides a way to maintain a list of categorized locations.

### Usage

running the app

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

dev environment (with hot reload enabled)

```sh
$ npm run start:dev
```

linting (eslint & csscomb)

```sh
$ npm run lint
```

### To be done:

- validate user input (all fields are required)
- implement `view` action for locations (open map & device vibration)
- use lodash for store handling
- look deeper into dev vs prod setup
- sorting (alphabetical order)
- give a way to group locations by category
- allow relating multiple categories to a single item
- tests
